# Resampler for audio waveform processing

The purpose of this library is to help you change the sample rate of the audio file.
For example, you have a 22050 Hz sample rate audio file, but you want a 48000 Hz sample rate audio file, you need resampling.
Here is the resampler to help you losslessly stretch/compress the waveform to fit the sample rate.

## How to use

### First determine which FFT size fits you.

The best FFT size should be the minimum 2^n number of your sample rate. You have source sample rate and target sample rate, choose the largest.
For example, you want to stretch 22050 to 48000ï¼Œthe best FFT size should be 65536.

### Create the `Resampler` struct

```rust
let resampler = Resampler::new(65536);
```

### Ask the `resampler` for the best process size

```rust
let source_sample_rate = 22050;
let target_sample_rate = 48000;

let process_size = resampler.get_process_size(resampler.get_fft_size(), source_sample_rate, target_sample_rate);
```

### Do resampling in blocks. Each block size should be `process_size`

```rust
let source_audio = vec![0.0f32; 114514]; // Assume this is the waveform you want to resample
let target_audio = vec![0.0f32; 0];

let mut iter = source_audio.iter();
loop {
    let block: Vec<f32> = iter.by_ref().take(process_size).copied().collect();
    if block.is_empty() {
        break;
    }
    let block = resampler.resample(block, source_sample_rate, target_sample_rate).unwarp();
    target_audio.extend(block);
}
```

### After that, your `target_audio` is the resampled audio. No artifacts are introduced by the resampler.
